# Exploring the MLB data

```{r}
load("../../data/mlb.RData")
ls()
head(mlb)
```

## Questions: 

  - How many observations are in the dataset?
  - Who is the tallest / smallest player?
  - Are players older than 32 significantly heavier than younger players?
  
## lapply / anonymous function: Who is the average size by position?

1. split the dataset by position to obtain a list
2. run `mean` on the list

```{r}
by_pos <- split(mlb,factor(mlb$Position))
sizes <- sapply(by_pos,function(x) mean(x$height))
sizes
```

## A custom function: What's the size of these players in centimeters?

```{r}
inchToCm <- function(size_in_inch,meters = T,digits=2){
  out <- size_in_inch * 2.54
  if(meters) out <- round(out/100,digits=2)
  out
}
inchToCm(sizes)
```
