knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Outline

- repeat what you must not forget (classics)
- introduction to shiny
- simple tasks in R (with built-in data)
- writing an own function
- R and data
- more custom functions
- discuss app ideas (blue prints)
- visualization

# Warmup 

## Basic R objects

- vector
- matrix
- data.frame
- list

## Repetitio est ... 

- What does '<-' mean?
- What's the difference between (),[] and {}?

## Getting to know your workplace (R Studio IDE)

- 4 panes
- console 
- script tabs (cmd+enter / ctrl+enter)
- projects (.Rproj)
- autocomplete (tab)

## Suggested Folder Structure For Course Projects

- data/ 
- R/ (functions)
- tests/ (function calls)
- inst/app (shiny)

# Introduction to Shiny

## Shiny Web Application Framework

[shiny](shiny-12-17.html)

# Simple Tasks in R

## Task I: Working On a Built-In Dataset

1. How many observations does the dataset mtcars have?
2. What's the miles-per-gallon average, median?
3. Which car does consume the least fuel? 
4. Which is the car the least fuel by cylinders?
5. How is mpg distributed?
6. Why does solving analytics exercises through programming make sense?

# Data Analysis Strategy

## First Steps

1. Validate
2. Summarize / Descriptive Stats
3. Identify "rocks" 
4. Choose methods
5. Apply methods

## Validate - Which functions do I need?

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=T}
head()
tail()
str()
class()
table()
```

## Summarize - Which functions do I need?

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=T}
summary()
table()
mean()
median()
sd()
var()
cor()
quantile()
```

## Identify 'rocks' - Which functions do I need?

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=T}
plot()
pairs()
hist()
plot(density())
```
packages like ggplot2, lattice or dygraphs provide you 
with more...

## Methods for inference, deeper analysis

- regression
- statistical tests
- factor analysis
- principal components
- seasonal adjustment
- ...

## Task II 

- run `data()`
- work in groups, pick a dataset
- work through steps 1-3
- present the dataset to others

## How about all datasets at once?

## Common Functions for Data Input/Output

```{r,eval=FALSE}
save()
load()
write.csv()
read.csv()
read.xlsx()
write.xlsx()
fromJSON()
toJSON()
```

remember: 

- binary vs. text, nested vs. 2 dimensional
- stringAsFactors=TRUE may be the worst default in R !

## Task II

- get the mlb dataset from github
- check the weight and height cols. 
- Create a custom function that converts inches to centimeters!
- advanced: built the function's interface in a way that it could easily be used to convert US pounds to kg.

## Short note on documentation

- Give the function a title
- write a short summary
- document all parameters
- provide an example
- roxygen style comments are one way to document
package ready
- implement unit tests if you are serious about your functions (e.g. use testthat package)

## Take a Break: RMarkdown

Do you plan to write an empirical thesis?
Ok then. Sit back and relax and enjoy an 
introduction to R Markdown.

## Let's Bring a Simple Example to Shiny

- load your favorite dataset
- think of a simple interaction that needs an input parameter
- think of a simple output
